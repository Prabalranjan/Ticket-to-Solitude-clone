            One of the most sought out trekking destinations of recent time in pristine Northeast India is Dzükou 
            <br> <br>

            Valley in Kohima at the border of Nagaland and Manipur. It’s pristine and adventurous, therefore how can I miss this destination! Hence, after wrapping up one phase of academics I scheduled the journey with Nomadic Connection in the month of July. A total of 12 adventure enthusiasts from different places of Assam on board! Dzükou valley can be reached both from Nagaland and Manipur but the most-traveled route is from Nagaland. To reach Nagaland, the most convenient way is to board a train from Guwahati to Dimapur, the largest city of Nagaland. (Do not forget to carry the Inner Line Permit (ILP) just to be on the safe side while checking. This is easily available from Nagaland House in Six Mile, Guwahati and takes a day to get issued.) 
            <br> <br>
            To our surprise, this journey greeted us with everything unexpected starting from Guwahati. Our train which was scheduled for midnight got delayed by four hours and we had to start our journey at 4 in the morning, which was definitely not according to what was planned. The plan was to board the midnight train which arrives at Dimapur around 5 in the morning and from where regular vehicles ply up to the capital city, Kohima in the morning hours. 
            <br> <br>
            Since our train got delayed, we reached Dimapur around 1030 in the morning. As expected, all the vehicles to Kohima have left early and not a single vehicle was available. Thankfully it was a Saturday because on Sundays almost every place is shut as the locals remain engaged in prayers at the Church. After reaching out to all our contacts, we could manage to get a BOLERO pick-up truck that would drop us till Kohima! We had no other option.
            <br> <br>
            Not wasting much time, we loaded our rucksacks with tents and sleeping bags in the truck and headed to Kohima, which is approximately 75kms from Dimapur. With two of us seated at the front accompanying the driver, the rest kept standing behind the whole journey, with Quechua and Forclaz poncho’s put on!

            <br> 
            To add more adventure to our journey, the under constructed muddy road and traffic with the rains, added extra 5 hours to the journey instead of an estimated 4 hours, making it a total of 9 hours to reach Kohima. On reaching Kohima it was already too late and the dipping temperature numb the whole body. It was around 9:30 pm and was next to impossible to start the trek at this time. 
            <br> <br>
            At this point, amidst the entire unplanned schedule, a kind and humble gesture from a local youth named Alex made us forget the entire tiredness of the day’s journey -- guess what – he offered us to spend the night at his place! He must be a crazy guy, we thought - offering twelve of us to stay at his place! But he was totally serious about it. Accepting his kind gesture, we proceeded to his house. We received a warm welcome from the entire family. Having cleaned up soon, we gathered at their traditional Naga fireplace. With slow-cooked food on fire, conversations went on and on past midnight. Finally, amidst a homely welcome, we had our dinner together at the cozy naga-style kitchen and then off to take some good sleep as the early morning awaits us to welcome our trek to the much-awaited Valley!
            <br> <br>
            It was early the next morning that we could actually see the place we were at. With the mild and warm rays of the morning sun, the place looked amazing. The view of the mountains and the lush green cover, multi-colored flowers, chirping of birds, all added to the monsoon beauty. Without much delay, we had our breakfast and loaded our baggage in the pickup truck to make our way to the starting point of the trek. There are two ways to get to the valley, one through Zakhama point and the other through Viswema point. The route through Zakhama takes a longer time with much less steep climb whereas; the route through Viswema takes comparatively less time but a steeper trek. Hence, respecting nature and the prevailing rainy weather, we chose the Zakhama route. After completing the formalities at the start point, we headed for the final trek around 10 in the morning.
            <br> <br>
            With our rucksacks on our back, we could literally think of a challenging way ahead. A combination of steps and entangled roots on the rocks led us to the mid-way point to the valley after 3 hours of slippery climb. But of course, the chirping of birds in the mossy forest and the chilled wind relieved us in between letting us much closer to Mother Nature in spite of the breathless climb.

            At the mid-point of the valley, strokes of chilled wind almost blew us away. Some snacks at this point of the trek were much needed; hence, grabbed a Sneakers and some energy drink to boost us for the rest of the trek. Following this, we resumed our way to the valley. All we could see was the parallel green valley’s meeting at some point and hear the water gushing through the rocks nearby. The view mesmerized us to no bounds - Spectacular! Now the route was to follow the edge of the valley and keep on moving from one valley to another till we could spot the resting place. Without any doubt, the route challenged us again. It seemed like we made our way through a chocolate syrup-y narrow lane. Our shoes were all covered with mud and the rain refused to pause for the day. We’ve crossed several bamboo underways, streams, some huge rocks that 
            <br> <br>

            <br> <br> 
            seemed like hanging from the muddy ground to find that there’s still a long way to go. On every person we would meet returning from the valley, we asked how far it is as we were running out of breath! Hours passed by and still, we were far behind. With the sky turning dusky, we could hear the croaks of frogs from nearby streams that followed. But after a strenuous 6 hours of trek, we finaaally reached the resting spot. Stood there for a while, mesmerized by the splendid Dzükou Valley - at approximately 2500 meters above sea level! No camera lens would capture the feeling of being right on top of the valley. It was to be felt only!

            As we looked around, the space was filled with tourists and a little left to pitch our tents. Hurriedly, we unloaded the rucksacks and started to pitch our tents as the sun went down. The chilly wind literally blew our effort in pitching the tent. After struggling for a while, we finally pitched all the tents! With the dipping temperature and chilly breeze, all of us gathered near the fireplace. It was time for some spicy food then - after which we directly headed back to our tent with body battery-level indicating low!
            <br> <br>
            Early next morning was the most awaited morning for which we passed all the challenges posed by Nature. With the break of dawn, we stood outside our tents to engulf ourselves into the beauty of the Valley. A white cloudy blanket filled the entire valley and as it cleared, the mild sun-rays followed. Its scenic beauty knew no boundaries. Far, at a distance, we could spot the border of Manipur and Nagaland. We explored the valley and reached out to find the beautiful pink lilies – 
            <br> <br>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Dzükou lily. Photo: Shekhar Goswami</p>
            
            the Dzükou Lilies found only in the valley during the month of July-September. The valley is surrounded by two rivers – Dzükou and Japhu which flows crossing each other with natural bridges to cross the narrow rivers in the valley. 
            <br> <br>
            After exploring the valley and capturing some beautiful memories, we headed back to the campsite. With our hearts and tummies filled up by now, we started to de-pitch our tents and clean the campsite for the next hikers. Though Dzükou valley has been declared as a plastic-free zone, yet many unconscious visitors have dumped plastics and other non-biodegradable items compromising on the beauty of the valley. Travelers should be concerned enough to care for such a beauty of nature. Hence, all possible trash was collected to be disposed off on our way back. The delays and on-road conditions having added to our trip, we could only stay for a night at the valley. Soon we had to make our way back through the chocolate syrup-y route to reach the start point where the pickup truck was waiting. Amongst us, a few including me had been trekking for long, but this Monsoon trek offered the best trekking experience we could ever think of!

            I am definitely heading to this place again to explore the alternate route. With all the smiling faces on our way back, we started loading our baggage into the truck but this time we laid our sleeping bags and made ourselves comfortable as we had a long way to reach Dimapur. The sun has set already and the cool breeze started blowing. Having traveled overnight to reach our scheduled train early the next morning, we found ourselves challenged again! The check-gate point before reaching Dimapur remains closed until 5 am and so we waited at the check post scrolling through the canceled tickets and checking the earliest availability to reach Guwahati. Finally, at 0645 hrs, we boarded a train to Guwahati, cherishing all the good experiences and challenges that made our trek the most memorable one!

            A huge Thank You to Alex for providing the warm hospitality and Seyei, for driving us all the way from Dimapur to Kohima and back to Dimapur. Not to forget Nomadic Connection – as through them the network of this zealous group was built. Sometimes, an off-planned trip turns out to be the most adventurous of all! On that happy note -  All's well that ends well!
